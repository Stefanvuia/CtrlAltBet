# Instructions for the Various Games

- War:

The game is normally played with six standard 52-card decks. The cards are ranked in the same way that cards in poker games are ranked, with aces being the highest cards.[2]

One card each is dealt to a dealer and to a player. If the player's card is higher, they win the wager they bet. However, if the dealer's card is higher, the player loses their bet.[3]

A tie occurs when the dealer and the player each have cards of the same rank. In a tie situation, the player has two options:

The player can surrender, in which case the player loses half the bet.
The player can go to war, in which case the player must double their stake.
If the player continues play in view of a tie, the dealer burns (discards) three cards before dealing each of them an additional card. If the player's card is ranked higher than the dealer's, then the player wins 1.5 times the amount of their original wager only. If the dealer's card is ranked higher than the player's, the player loses their (doubled) wager. If the ranks are equal, then the player wins the amount of their doubled wager.

- BlackJack:

The game is normally played with six standard 52-card decks. 10, Jack, Queen, and King all have a value of 10, numbered cards have a value equal to their number, and ace has a value of 11 or 1 depending on whether or not an 11 would make your sum go over 21.

The game starts with two cards each being dealt to a dealer and a player. Only one of the dealer's cards is visible.

The player has the option to hit or stand. 
- Hit: The dealer adds a card to the player's hand
- Stand: No more cards are added and now it's the dealer's turn to hit
  
If the player has an ace and a card with a value of 10 they have blackjack. If the dealer's hand does not sum 21 by the end of their turn the player wins 3/2 of their wager or breaks even otherwise.
If the player's hand sum is more than the dealers without going over 21, they win their wager.
If the player's hand sum is less than the dealers with going over 21, they win their wager.
If the player's hand sum is more than 21 they lose their wage by default.
